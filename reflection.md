# Reflection Document

Objective:

What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?

- The main goals we were supposed to accomplish were practice with error checking, decision making, and loops

Procedure:

What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?

- I split the repeatable tasks into different loops, used a random number that's unattainable through user input to
show that no other user input is required before the end of the game section, and used a lot of formatting techniques
to make it look pretty

What were the Key concepts explored?

- Error checking, loops, and decision making

Results:

Did your results match what you expected to get?

- Eventually, yes

Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?

- I tested the error checking by inputting invalid values. This is how I fixed most of the code

Reflection:

What challenges did you encounter?

- The biggest challenge was formatting the outputs so they wouldn't look like a block of text

How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?

- I did a lot of thinking before (and some while) coding, put various comments in the code, and definitely got a lot of
practice with formatting, which I had not done much of previously

Did you overcome them, and how?

- I practiced using \t and \n to split the outputs up

Any key takeaways?

- It's important to check your error checking, to make sure the error checking checks the errors correctly

Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?

- I think I did

What was it like working by yourself?

- It felt good to work on my own schedule, but there's no good replacement for peer review
